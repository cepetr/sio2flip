# Atari SIO Peripheral Emulator for Flipper Zero

sio2flip emulates SIO peripherals for Atari 8-bit computers, currently featuring floppy drive emulation, direct XEX executable loading and Atari 850 modem emulation.

## Wiring

Only three signals plus ground are used. Note that Atari SIO uses 5V TTL logic; although the Flipper Zero I/Os are 5V tolerant when configured correctly, careful wiring is essential to avoid damage.

- TX (13) - SIO DIN
- RX (14) - SIO DOUT
- C0 (16) - SIO COMMAND
- GND (18) - SIO GND

## Instructions

Place ATR disk images in */apps_data/sio2flip/atr/* and XEX files in */apps_data/sio2flip/xex/* on the Flipperâ€™s SD card.
